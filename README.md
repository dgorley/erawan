## P.S.: What's with the name?

*Erawan* is the Thai name for *Airavata*, the three-headed elephant representing
the Hindu gods **Brahma** (the creator), **Vishnu** (the keeper), and **Mahesh**
(the destroyer).  The elephant represents PostgreSQL, and the three heads follow
the process Erawan applies to backups.
